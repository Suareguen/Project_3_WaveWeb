## About "Wave Web":

"Wave Web" evokes a connection with the sea and nature, representing fluidity and constant evolution. The word "Wave" suggests dynamic energy and continuous movement, reflecting the changing nature of business and technology. The sea symbolizes vast possibilities and an adventurous spirit.

The choice of "Wave Web" also holds a more personal significance for us as developers. As Canarians connected to the sea and nature, the name reflects our deep roots to the land but also our desire to explore new opportunities, much like the waves that constantly change while maintaining an essential connection to their origin.

Furthermore, the duality of "Wave Web" can be interpreted as the convergence of two worlds: the digital world of the web and the natural world of the sea, blending technology with the beauty and strength of nature.

In summary, "Wave Web" encapsulates the idea of a dynamic project, in constant change and evolution, rooted in the connection with nature and the pursuit of new experiences.
